We provide 20 trained weight here. Users can deploy BEN as an out-of-the-box tool instantly if their data domain are contained within the after-mentioned lists.

In detail, for the introduction of a new dataset, we suggest that the user do as follows.
1) First, use BEN to load the pretrained weights for the closest corresponding species.
2) Consider labeling several scans to fine-tune the model if the pretrained weights do not yield satisfactory performance or the target species is beyond the scope of our datasets. The domain transfer procedures will be performed automatically, without human intervention.


Note:
This is the first version of trained weights. As most of our experiments focus on limited labels for domain adaptation, originally, some of the weights were not trained on the full dataset. Thus, the performance might not be optimal.

In the next step plan, we will retrain all models and update these resources. It will take a few weeks.

If you have any questions or there is an urgent need for an update to a specific domain weight, feel free to contact us.
